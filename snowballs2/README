1. What's this document about?
   ---------------------------

This document contains useful information about SNOWBALLS, NeL, Nevrax,
technical requirements, and caveats about compilation and installation.
It also includes a short "user manual" for the programs provided. It is
highly recommended reading.


2. What are NeL and Nevrax
   -----------------------

You should really take a look at the http://www.nevrax.org/ (for NeL)
and http://www.nevrax.com/ (for Nevrax). NeL is a free software
framework developped and maintained by Nevrax Ltd, for the purpose of
building internet multiuser entertainment.

Nevrax is a company dedicated to Free Software, which is why our
tools are covered by the GPL. See the attached license file.


3. What's in the package?
   ----------------------

The package contains:

   - The latest source code for the NeL client and server frameworks
   - The source code and data for a sample NeL game called 'SNOWBALLS'

If you have a source distribution, you need to compile the source to
produce the various executables. If you have a binary distribution,
you have a pre-built exe client for Snowballs, but no source.

The source code is provided as is, and reflects the state of the NeL
framework at the release date. We have done our best to insure that the
snapshot you are using now compiles and works correctly. However, we
only test on a limited range of configurations, and the vagaries of
OS and hardware means we cannot guarantee it compiles and executes
correctly on your system at the time.

If you are using CVS, you can keep in synch with the NeL Development Team 
as we have included the required CVS information. An update will give you 
current source. We do not guarantee that the source in CVS will compile 
and work correctly at all time as it includes the latest work in progress.


4. Caveat
   ------

The sample client, server and data files provided do not accurately reflect
our game currently in production. We do not intend penguins and gnus to appear
in the final game, and most of the gameplay you will see does not reflect
what we will implement later.


5. Compiling NeL and SNOWBALLS
   ---------------------------

You will need a C++ compiler to properly compile and execute the NeL
framework. The program compiles reasonably under a Unix/GCC environment,
but it has been chiefly tested under a Linux environment.

The server has been compiled and executed on a Windows machine, but it
is highly recommended that you run it on a separate GNU/Linux machine. The
client has been compiled and executed on a GNU/Linux machine, but will
probably not work on other unix compatible systems (yet).

The client and server require an operating TCP/IP stack to communicate.

The data files for the client and server should be in the ./data child 
directories of the directory in which the executables are located.

See the INSTALL file for the requirements and installation instructions.


6. Running SNOWBALLS
   -----------------

It is highly recommended that you run the client on a PC with plenty of 
main memory (128Megs+) and a 3D card that supports T&L in hardware and 
has 32Mb of memory. Lesser configurations will probably give you very 
poor framerates.

If you want to run your own server, start the naming service on the
machine that you want to use as a server. The binary is named,
appropriately, naming_service. Otherwise, you may use the default server
itsalive.nevrax.org, which is hosted here at Nevrax.

The client starts normally. Once started, you'll be asked to select
your langage. You then fill in a name and password (which must be
alpha-numeric), and you'll be able to enter the test area. If you enter
a user name that has never been used before on the server that you are
connected to then a new account will be created with the password that
you enter at the 'PASSWORD' prompt. You'll need to remeber this password
as you'll need each time you login in the future.

Select now your character type and server to play on, and you're set.

You're now a penguin on an artic snowfield. You have snowballs which you
can throw at other people. When you throw a snowball, you have a few
seconds during which you gather more snow before you can throw the next
one. If you hit someone, your score increases, and the snowed opponent 
becomes immune to further snowing (he flashes on the screen) for 5s. He
cannot retaliate while invulnerable.

If you get stuck somehow, remove the client.cfg file from your client
directory, and restart. Good luck. If you find a penguin named TMS on
the server, it's me, throw me a low one :)
