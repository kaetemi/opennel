Extra WeblogEntry Content Types/Weblog Filters
==============================================

- Blogmark (link blog)
- Photoblog (photo blog.  Replacement for CMFPhoto[Album]?)

Category Portlet
================

NOTE: We are using 'Topics', however the term 'Categories' seem to be more
widely recognized in welobgs.  Should we do a rename before 1.0?

List all categories in the current weblog...this of course requires a nice way
to view individual categories...

Calendar Integration
====================

Is there any means for integrating content-types into the calendar without
hacking them to masquerade as Events?  If not, we need our own calendar.

Likely solution: Create a new calendar portlet that will check for a
'isCalendarable' property (or something easier to say) to see what should be
displayed in the calendar.  Also check the Calendaring product to see how it
integrates with things.

Issues that need resolving
==========================

Move direct access of uid_catalog to Archetypes' get-object-by-UID API.
update: Tiran told me that uid_catalog *is* the right way....
