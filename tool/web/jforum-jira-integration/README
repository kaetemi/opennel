JForum-JIRA-Integration "jauthira"
==============================================================================

This is a Maven2 project which contains 2 classes,

org.nevrax.open.jforum.JiraLoginAuthenticator

  which acts as a LoginAuthenticator, means it replaces the normal
  DefaultLoginAuthenticator of JForum. It connects to the JIRA SOAP
  interface and checks if the credentials match a user registered
  at JIRA, if it is the case and there is no such user in JForum,
  a new user with default settings is generated.

  Everytime a user logs in the password stored in the JForum user
  record is updated with the JIRA one.

  Depending on the configuration the JiraLoginAuthenticator allows
  for a fallback LoginAuthenticator, which is used in the case the
  connection to the JIRA SOAP service is completely broken. Without
  such a fallback defined, an exception is raised instead.


org.nevrax.open.jforum.JiraSSOAuthenticator

  is an implementation of the Single-Sign-On integration solution
  explained in the JForum documentation. It expects a "seraph.os.cookie"
  to be defined in a path which is accessible to the JForum, otherwise
  the SSO won't work.

  Once the setup of the websites is done properly (or fixed in regard
  to that cookie), and this authenticator detects this cookie, it
  will crosscheck the user in JIRA using it's SOAP service and either
  stay with the default ("anonymous") or with the user defined in the
  "seraph.os.cookie". In the latter case matching JForum cookies are
  defined as well. Loggin off from JIRA also implies a logoff from
  JForum, as the "seraph.os.cookie" gets deleted in the logoff process.


"mvn install"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run a "mvn install", a jforum.jar must be compiled first. It's done
by creating a jar-file out of the classes located in the WEB-INF/classes
directory in an extracted JForum installation.

This jar-file needs to be added to the local maven repository by calling

  mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=jforum -DartifactId=jforum \
      -Dversion=2.1.7 -Dpackaging=jar -DcreateChecksum=true     \
      -DgeneratePom=true -Dfile=<path to JForum-jar-file>

Then a simple "mvn install" should do compile a jar file into the target/
subdirectory of this project. This file, together with

* axis.jar (Axis 1),
* jaxrpc.jar,
* saaj.jar,
* commons-discovery-0.2.jar and
* wsdl4j-1.5.1.jar

(check your maven repository under ~/.m2/) should be copied to the
WEB-INF/lib directory of JForum. Change the configuration files accordingly,
namely WEB-INF/config/SystemGlobals.properties. See
src/main/java/org/nevrax/open/jforum/JiraConfigKeys.java for an explanation
of the different keys required.


JIRA configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get things running, JIRA needs the SOAP/RPC plugin activated, which is
described in detail in the JIRA documentation at

  http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+XML-RPC+Overview

under "Enable the RPC plugin".

For the SSO method to work, JIRA must either run in the root-context of
the servlet container (e.g. Tomcat) or the Seraph framework it uses must
be changed so the "seraph.os.cookie" isn't located in the JIRA context
path. See the references/docs about HTTP-Cookies for further details
about the details of the "path"-value.

The normal login method should work out of the box as soon as the RPC-plugin
is enabled and the JForum configuration is set to the proper SOAP-endpoint
path of the JIRA application.
