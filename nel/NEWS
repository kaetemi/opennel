April 30 2002
=============

*  NLNET: Added 3 new variables "NegFiltersDebug" and "NegFiltersInfo" (array of string) that
          call addNegativeFilter at the init of the service. You could change these variables
          in realtime with a notepad.

* NLMISC: CPath::addSeachPath() class now filter CVS directory and *.log files.


April 23 2002
=============

*  NLNET: Added a new variable "StartCommands" (array of string) that execute these commands
          at the startup of the service (after the init() and before the first update()).

* NLMISC: Added a new variable "RootConfigFilename" (string) that is a config filename that
          will be read. It's used to set common variable in a common file for all services.


March 28 2002

          ex: int val = 100; string res = toString ("0x%x", val);

March 15 2002
=============

* NLMISC: CCommand now manages spaces within parameters, putting "" around parameters.

* NLMISC: CHTimer: Hierarchical time that allows to measure accurately the performance of routines,
          and displays results hierarchically. To time a piece of code, just declare a static.
          CHTimer object and encapsulate code between calls to before() and after() methods.

*  NLNET: New msgin and msgout commands in services to simulate incoming
          messages from a service and send messages to other services
