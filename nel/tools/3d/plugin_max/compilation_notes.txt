** DISTRIBUTION NOTES **

Given that Max plug-ins are linked to the 3DSMax SDK (which is not Gnu GPL) 
and to NeL (which is Gnu GPL), anyone distributing plug-ins in binary form will be in 
breach of the Gnu GPL.
 
In English than means that you shouldn't distribute the plug-ins as binaries.
You are, of course, free to distribute the source code.

** PROJECTS **

There is three plug-ins in this package:

1) nel_export : an export /view utility plug-in for NeL.
2) nel_patch_converted : a patch converter to translate max patches in NeL patches.
3) tile_utility : an utility plug-in to load tile banks in 3dsmax.

** DEPENDENCIES **

Thoses plug-ins need some sub projects to work with:

1) NeL 3d library
2) NeL misc library
3) NeL openGL driver
4) nel_mesh_lib : library of functions to convert max Meshes and animation data in NeL format.
5) nel_patch_lib : library of functions to convert max patches in NeL format.
6) object_viewer : the common NeL tool to watch nel objects and animations.
7) nel_3dsmax_shared : shared dll for NeL plug-ins

** INSTALL **

Once all those projects are compiled you should have:

* nelexport.dlu
* neltileutility.dlu
* nelconvertpatch.dlm. 

Thoses dll must go in a plugins directory of 3dsmax. (ex: c:/3dsmax3_1/plugins)

* nel_3dsmax_shared.dll
* object_viewer.dll
* nel_drv_opengl_win.dll

Thoses dll must go in the 3dsmax root directory. (ex: c:/3dsmax3_1)
