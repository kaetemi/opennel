 * The following ifdef block is the standard way of creating macros which make exporting 
 * from a DLL simpler. All files within this DLL are compiled with the NEL_3DSMAX_SHARED_EXPORTS
 * symbol defined on the command line. this symbol should not be defined on any project
 * that uses this DLL. This way any other project whose source files include this file see 
 * NEL_3DSMAX_SHARED_API functions as being imported from a DLL, wheras this DLL sees symbols
 * defined with this macro as being exported.
