 * Ambiant color
 * Diffuse color
 * Specular color
 * Self illumation value (pseudo)
 * Self illumation color (pseudo)
 * Opacity
 * Shininess (pseudo)
 * Glosness (pseudo)
 * Diffuse texture 
 * Opacity texture. If opacity texture and diffuse texture are used, NeL try to use the alpha channel of the diffuse texture as opacity map.
 * Double sided
 * You can use crop if you don't repeat the texture.
 * You can use crop and repeat the texture on U if the U crop is full (0 -> 1).
 * You can use crop and repeat the texture on V if the V crop is full (0 -> 1).
 * Extended parameters transparency type (filter or additive)
 * Specular is used throught cube environnement mapping (use composite to give the 6 faces a unique texture)

-------------------------------------------------

-> How to use lightmaps

Use a NeL material.
Check the box "lightmap".
You material MUST have a texture.
The object must be mapped.
You can map your object twice using the second mapping channel for the lightmap. (Use CopyMap)

YOU CAN
-------
Lightmap can be used with vertex color
Lightmap can be used with alpha test
The material diffuse color is used
The material ambiante color is used

YOU CAN'T
---------
Lightmap can't be used with alpha vertex
Lightmap can't be used with multitexture
Lightmap can't be used with specular map
The material specular color is not used
The material opacity is not used
The material can't be used with extended parameters transparency type (filter or additive)

-------------------------------------------------

-> How to use "color vertex"

See the sample "color vertex.max"
Use a NeL material.
Check the box "color vertex".
You can edit your vertex color with vertex paint or edit mesh.

-------------------------------------------------

-> How to use "alpha vertex"

See the sample "alpha vertex.max"
Use a NeL material.
Check the box "alpha vertex".
Choose the channel to use as alpha. You can edit your vertex color with "vertex paint" or "edit mesh".
Then copy it with "CopyMap" in the selected channel for alpha vertex.
The source of the copy must be 0, the destination is the channel you have choosed in the NeL material.
