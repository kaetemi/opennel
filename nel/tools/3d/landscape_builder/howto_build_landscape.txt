How to build the NeL landscape.

WHAT DOES MEAN 'BUILD THE NeL LANDSCAPE':
-----------------------------------------

Once you have created your tile bank and your landscape zones, you will need to preprocess your zone
in order to:

- Weld the boundary vertices of the zones
- Light the zones with shadows casted by the landscape and the static objects (like trees, buildings..)

REQUIREMENT:
------------

Before building the landscape you must have:

- Install Cygwin tools and set the PATH properly. (Under windows)
- Compilated some binaries and putted them in the "bin/" folder. (zone_dependencies.exe, zone_welder.exe, zone_lighter.exe. zone_smoother.exe is not use anymore)

DATA EXPORTATION:
-----------------

You have to export those data:

- The .zone files in the "zone_exported/" folder. (NeL landscape zone files exported from 3dsmax)
- The .bank file in the "bank/" folder. (NeL bank edited with tileedit)
- The .ig files (named like the zone) in the folder "ig/". (NeL instance group file exported from max)
