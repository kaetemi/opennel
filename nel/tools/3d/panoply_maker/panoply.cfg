// 60 Yellow

// 180 Cyan
// 240 Blue
// 300 Magenta

// lightness are in the [-1, 1] range and are interpreted as a relative value
// brightness are in the [-1, 1] range and are interpreted as a relative value

// luminosities is interpreted as an added gray level. It typically is in the [-1, 1] range
// A luminositie of 0 means it is unmodified
// contrasts tells how the distance of colors from the means of their components
// If the contrasts is 0 we got a grey tint
// If the contrast is 1 the colors is unmodified
// Contrasts above 1 tends to pure colors.
