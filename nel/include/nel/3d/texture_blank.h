 * This texture does generate nothing, and it is releasable. There's no particular reason to use it,
 * unless you want to copy the frame buffer in a texture. You may use that texture so that the device memory
 * will only be allocated once, and the system memory (needed to create the texture, at least with open gl) will be released after that. 
 * A texture_mem could have been used, but it doesn't release memory by itself (added : hmm, well it does since 2/2002 ...).
