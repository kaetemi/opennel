/**
 * Game interface for localized environment sounds
 *
 * An envsound object is a node of an envsound tree, the root of which
 * is returned by UAudioMixer::loadEnvSounds(). The root is the world
 * envsound: it has no bounds. The areas of children envsounds have
 * bounds and they must be totally included in the area of their
 * parent envsound.
 *
 * For arguments as 3D vectors, use the NeL vector coordinate system:
 * \verbatim
 *     (top)
 *       z    
 *       |  y (front)
 *       | /
 *       -----x (right)
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * An envsound source plays with the priority HighPri, and has the
 * priority LowPri when not playing.
