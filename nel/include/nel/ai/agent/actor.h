	Class Actor
	You can think of activation as a set of tokens passed between actors. The number of tokens isn't fixed, which means
	one transition can activate more than one actor.
	An actor has a list of conditions under which he's going to pass activation to other actors.
	A simple state machine is a particular case in which there's always only one token for all actors.
	If a run() is defined, the actor becomes an active agent with an activity at each cycle.
