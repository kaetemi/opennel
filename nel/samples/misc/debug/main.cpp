	// in general, in debug mode, all debug functions are active, they display
	// what happens and some break the program to debug it. In release mode, they often
	// do nothing to increase the execution speed.


	// this function initializes debug functions. it adds displayers into the debug
	// logger.
	// in debug mode, all debug functions display on the std output.
	// in release mode, this function does nothing by default. you have to add a displayer
	// manually, or put true in the parameter to say to the function that you want it to
	// add the default displayers
	createDebug ();

	// display debug information, that will be skipped in release mode.
	nldebug ("nldebug() %d", 1);

	// display the string
	nlinfo ("nlinfo() %d", 2);

	// when something not normal, but that the program can manage, occurs, call nlwarning()
	nlwarning ("nlwarning() %d", 3);

	// nlassert() is like assert but do more powerful things. in release mode, the test is
	// not executed and nothing will happen. (Press F5 in Visual C++ to continue the execution)
	nlassert (true == false);

	// in a switch case or when you want that the program never executes a part of code, use stop.
	// in release, nlstop does nothing. in debug mode,
	// if the code reaches the nlstop, a breakpoint will be set. (In Visual C++ press F5 to continue)
	nlstop;

	// when the program failed, call nlerror(), it displays the message and throws a EFatalError to
	// exit the program. don't forget to put a try/catch block everywhere an nlerror could
	// occurs. (In Visual C++ press F5 to continue)
